Hey everyone! "Syllabus week" is officially over and I'm feeling pretty good about this class so far.  I have never had Downing before, but I only hear how amazing his classes are, so I'm looking forward to Software Engineering even though it looks like it will be quite the workload.  Downing doesn't allow all of our gadgetry in class which is a first for me, but from the first 2 classes it looks like we don't have time for them unless you want to get blindsided by Downing calling on you, which would be embarrassing to say the least.
    
My friend just recently took SWE this past summer and after looking at his final project, I'm exciting to create something on a similar scale.  I am nervous though since my extent of HTML and other web developement tools is limited.  However I'm going to try and get a head start and learn as much as possible before the project 3 starts so that I can be in the thick of things when my group is building our site.  I'm not very creative in my ideas though, so hopefully someone else in my group can come up with an awesome idea of what to build.

Finally my tip of the week!  If anybody is interested in python and wants an easy install.  Anaconda is a great distribution of python by continuum you can download and has more packages for math, science, and data science that you will probably will ever use.
